How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs begins with understanding the problem from the user’s perspective. During the SNHU Travel project, I analyzed requirements by reviewing the Product Owner’s feedback, customer goals, and acceptance criteria. Translating these needs into user stories helped me focus on what the user actually values. Each user story described the feature, the reason it was needed, and the expected result, which made it easier to design and prioritize functionality. This process ensured that my development work aligned with real user expectations instead of technical assumptions.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to development follows an iterative, feedback-driven cycle. I start by defining small, achievable goals, implement them, and then test the results before moving forward. Agile processes such as Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, and Retrospectives have taught me the importance of adaptability and collaboration. I plan to continue using user stories, sprint reviews, and backlog refinement in future projects. These practices allow me to break down large tasks, adjust priorities quickly, and continuously deliver value to users through incremental updates.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member contributes actively, communicates openly, and supports the team’s shared goals. In Agile development, success depends on trust and transparency. As a developer, I learned to be accountable for my work, give constructive feedback, and respect different roles such as the Scrum Master and Product Owner. Being a good team member means focusing on team outcomes rather than individual credit, ensuring that the product improves every sprint through collaboration, honesty, and consistent effort.
